                    <h2>📌 Chapter 1: What is Technology?</h2>

                    <h3>Understanding Technology</h3>
                    <p>Technology is all around us! When you hear the word "technology," you might think of computers, smartphones, or video games. But technology is much more than that. Technology includes any tool, machine, or system that people create to solve problems and make life easier.</p>

                    <p>From the simple pencil you use to write, to the complex satellite that helps us navigate with GPS, all of these are examples of technology. Technology has been part of human life for thousands of years, starting with simple tools like wheels and hammers, and continuing to the amazing inventions we have today.</p>

                    <p>The word "technology" comes from two Greek words: "techne" (meaning art or skill) and "logia" (meaning study of). So technology literally means "the study of making things." When we use technology, we're using the knowledge and skills that humans have developed over time to create useful things.</p>

                    <div class="fun-fact">
                        <h4>⭐ Fun Fact!</h4>
                        <p>The first computer programmer was a woman named Ada Lovelace in the 1840s - that's almost 200 years ago! She wrote instructions for a machine that was never built, but her ideas helped create modern computers.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Human-Made vs. Natural Things</h3>
                    <p>One important thing to understand about technology is that it's always human-made. This means people created it using their knowledge and creativity. Let's look at the difference between natural things and human-made (technological) things:</p>

                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Natural Things</th>

Computers come in many shapes and sizes - from huge supercomputers that fill entire rooms to tiny computers inside your watch or phone!</p>

                    <p>The word "computer" comes from "compute," which means to calculate or figure out. Early computers were built just to do math problems very quickly. Today's computers can do much more - they can show videos, play music, help you draw pictures, connect you to the internet, and run thousands of different programs.</p>

                    <p>What makes a computer special is that it can follow instructions very quickly and accurately. These instructions are called "programs" or "software." Without software, a computer is just a collection of electronic parts. With software, it becomes a powerful tool that can help us with almost anything!</p>

                        <h4>⭐ Fun Fact!</h4>
                        <p>The first electronic computer, called ENIAC, was built in 1945. It weighed 30 tons (as much as 6 elephants!) and filled a whole room. Today, a smartphone that fits in your pocket is millions of times more powerful than ENIAC!</p>

                    <h3>Parts of a Computer System</h3>
                    <p>A computer system has several main parts that work together. Think of it like a team where each player has an important job. Let's learn about each part:</p>

                    <h4>1. Input Devices</h4>
                    <p>Input devices let you put information INTO the computer. They're like the computer's ears and eyes - they help it understand what you want it to do.</p>

                    <h4>2. Output Devices</h4>
                    <p>Output devices let the computer send information OUT to you. They're like the computer's mouth and hands - they show you or give you the results of what the computer has done.</p>

                    <table>
                        <tr>

                    <div class="important-note">
                        <h4>📌 Important to Know</h4>
                        <p>Some devices are BOTH input AND output! For example, a touchscreen is output (shows you things) and input (lets you touch and control). Headphones with a microphone are output (plays sound) and input (records your voice). These are called "input/output devices" or "I/O devices."</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>3. The CPU (Central Processing Unit) - The Computer's Brain</h4>
                    <p>The CPU is the most important part of a computer. It's like the computer's brain! The CPU does all the thinking and calculating. Every time you click something, type something, or run a program, the CPU is working hard to process that information.</p>

                    <p>The CPU is incredibly fast - it can do billions of calculations every second! When we measure CPU speed, we use a unit called "Gigahertz" (GHz). A CPU running at 3 GHz can do 3 billion operations every second. That's faster than you can blink!</p>

                    <p>Inside the CPU are tiny switches called "transistors." Modern CPUs have billions of these tiny switches working together. The CPU reads instructions from programs and decides what to do with the data.</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: CPU at Work</h4>
                        <p>Imagine you're playing a math game on the computer. Here's what the CPU does:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Input:</strong> You type "5 + 3" on the keyboard</li>
                            <li><strong>Processing:</strong> The CPU receives this information and calculates the answer (8)</li>
                            <li><strong>Output:</strong> The CPU sends the answer to the monitor to display "8" on the screen</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This all happens in less than a second - so fast you don't even notice the CPU working!</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>4. Memory (RAM) - The Computer's Short-Term Memory</h4>
                    <p>RAM stands for "Random Access Memory." Think of RAM as the computer's short-term memory or workspace. When you open a program or file, the computer loads it into RAM so the CPU can work with it quickly.</p>

                    <p>RAM is very fast but temporary. When you turn off the computer, everything in RAM disappears! That's why you need to save your work before shutting down. The more RAM a computer has, the more programs it can run at the same time without slowing down.</p>

                    <p>RAM is measured in Gigabytes (GB). A typical computer today might have 4 GB, 8 GB, or 16 GB of RAM. Think of it like the size of your desk - a bigger desk (more RAM) lets you have more books and papers open at once!</p>

                    <h4>5. Storage - The Computer's Long-Term Memory</h4>
                    <p>Storage is where the computer keeps files, programs, and data permanently - even when it's turned off. This is like the computer's long-term memory or filing cabinet.</p>

                    <p>There are different types of storage:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Hard Disk Drive (HDD):</strong> Uses spinning magnetic disks to store data. It's slower but can store lots of information cheaply.</li>
                        <li><strong>Solid State Drive (SSD):</strong> Uses electronic chips (no moving parts). It's much faster than HDD but costs more.</li>
                        <li><strong>USB Flash Drive:</strong> A small, portable storage device you can carry in your pocket.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> Stores your files on computers on the internet so you can access them from anywhere.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Storage is also measured in Gigabytes (GB) or Terabytes (TB). One TB equals 1,000 GB! A typical computer might have 256 GB to 1 TB of storage.</p>

                    <h4>6. Motherboard - The Computer's Nervous System</h4>
                    <p>The motherboard is a large circuit board that connects all the parts of the computer together. It's like the computer's nervous system, allowing different parts to communicate with each other. The CPU, RAM, and other components all plug into the motherboard.</p>

                    <h4>7. Power Supply - The Computer's Energy Source</h4>
                    <p>The power supply converts electricity from the wall outlet into the right type of power for the computer's components. It's like the computer's stomach, taking in energy and distributing it to all the parts that need it.</p>

                    <h3>How Computers Work Together</h3>
                    <p>All these parts work as a team! Here's how they work together when you use a computer:</p>

                    <div class="example-box">

                            <li>You use the <strong>mouse (input)</strong> to click on a game icon</li>
                            <li>The <strong>CPU (processor)</strong> receives the command to open the game</li>
                            <li>The CPU loads the game from <strong>storage</strong> into <strong>RAM (memory)</strong></li>
                            <li>The CPU processes the game instructions</li>
                            <li>The <strong>monitor (output)</strong> shows the game on screen</li>
                            <li>The <strong>speakers (output)</strong> play the game's music</li>
                            <li>You use the <strong>keyboard (input)</strong> to control the game character</li>
                            <li>The CPU processes your controls and updates the game</li>
                            <li>The cycle continues as you play!</li>
                        </ol>

                    <h3>Types of Computers</h3>
                    <p>Computers come in many different shapes and sizes for different purposes:</p>

                    <h4>Desktop Computer</h4>
                    <p>A computer that sits on a desk. It has a separate monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Desktop computers are usually more powerful and easier to upgrade than other types.</p>

                    <h4>Laptop Computer</h4>
                    <p>A portable computer with a built-in screen and keyboard that you can fold and carry. Perfect for students who need to work in different places!</p>

                    <h4>Tablet</h4>
                    <p>A flat, touchscreen computer without a keyboard (though you can add one). Great for reading, watching videos, and browsing the internet.</p>

                    <h4>Smartphone</h4>
                    <p>A small, portable computer that fits in your pocket and can make phone calls. Smartphones are actually very powerful computers!</p>

                    <h4>Server</h4>
                    <p>A powerful computer that provides services to other computers over a network. When you visit a website, you're connecting to a server computer.</p>

                    <h3>Operating Systems: The Computer's Manager</h3>
                    <p>An operating system (OS) is the most important software on a computer. It's like the manager that controls everything! Without an operating system, your computer would just be a collection of parts that can't do anything useful.</p>

                    <h4>What Does an Operating System Do?</h4>
                    <p>The operating system has many important jobs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Manages Hardware:</strong> Controls the CPU, memory, storage, and all connected devices</li>
                        <li><strong>Runs Programs:</strong> Lets you open and use applications</li>
                        <li><strong>Manages Files:</strong> Organizes your documents, photos, and other files</li>
                        <li><strong>Provides User Interface:</strong> Shows you windows, icons, and menus you can click</li>
                        <li><strong>Handles Security:</strong> Protects your computer from viruses and unauthorized access</li>
                        <li><strong>Manages Memory:</strong> Decides which programs get to use RAM and how much</li>
                        <li><strong>Enables Multitasking:</strong> Lets you run multiple programs at the same time</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Software: Programs That Make Computers Useful</h3>
                    <p>Hardware is the physical computer, and software is the programs that run on it. There are two main types of software:</p>

                    <h4>1. System Software</h4>
                    <p>Software that runs the computer itself:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Operating System:</strong> Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>Device Drivers:</strong> Software that lets the OS communicate with hardware (like printer drivers)</li>
                        <li><strong>Utilities:</strong> Tools to maintain the computer (antivirus, disk cleanup, backup tools)</li>
                        <li><strong>Firmware:</strong> Software built into hardware devices</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>2. Application Software (Apps)</h4>

                    <h3>Computer Performance: Why Computers Get Slow</h3>
                    <p>Ever wonder why computers sometimes run slowly? Let's understand what affects computer speed:</p>

                    <h4>Factors That Affect Speed</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Too Many Programs Running:</strong> Each program uses RAM. Running too many programs at once can make everything slow.</li>
                        <li><strong>Low Storage Space:</strong> When storage is almost full, the computer has to work harder to save and find files.</li>
                        <li><strong>Not Enough RAM:</strong> If RAM is full, the computer uses slower storage as temporary memory.</li>
                        <li><strong>Old Hardware:</strong> Older CPUs and hard drives are naturally slower than new ones.</li>
                        <li><strong>Malware/Viruses:</strong> Harmful software can use up computer resources.</li>
                        <li><strong>Too Many Startup Programs:</strong> Programs that automatically start when the computer boots up slow down startup time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fragmented Hard Drive:</strong> On old HDDs, files get scattered and take longer to access.</li>
                        <li><strong>Overheating:</strong> If the computer gets too hot, it slows down to prevent damage.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>The Boot Process: What Happens When You Turn On a Computer?</h3>
                    <p>Have you ever wondered what happens in those few seconds between pressing the power button and seeing your desktop? Let's find out!</p>

                    <h4>Step-by-Step Boot Process</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Power On:</strong> You press the power button, and electricity flows to all components</li>
                        <li><strong>POST (Power-On Self-Test):</strong> The computer checks that all hardware is working properly. You might see a logo or lights flashing.</li>
                        <li><strong>BIOS/UEFI Loads:</strong> Basic Input/Output System firmware starts up. It's like the computer's "wake up" program.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bootloader Runs:</strong> A small program that knows how to start the operating system</li>
                        <li><strong>Operating System Loads:</strong> Windows, macOS, or Linux loads into RAM from storage</li>
                        <li><strong>System Services Start:</strong> Important background programs launch</li>
                        <li><strong>User Login:</strong> You see the login screen or desktop</li>
                        <li><strong>Startup Programs Launch:</strong> Any programs set to automatically start will now open</li>
                        <li><strong>Ready to Use:</strong> The computer is fully booted and ready for you!</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>All of this happens in 30-60 seconds on modern computers! Older computers or those with HDDs might take 2-3 minutes.</p>

                    <h2>📌 Chapter 3: Introduction to HTML</h2>

                    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
                    <p>HTML stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>. It's the language we use to create web pages! Every website you visit - Google, YouTube, your school's website - is built using HTML.</p>

                    <p>But HTML isn't a programming language like JavaScript or Python. It's a "markup language," which means it's used to structure and organize content. Think of HTML as the skeleton or framework of a webpage. It tells the web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) how to display text, images, videos, and links.</p>

                    <p>The "HyperText" part means that HTML can create links between pages. When you click a link and jump to another page, that's hypertext in action! The web is built on this ability to link pages together, creating a "web" of connected information.</p>

                    <div class="fun-fact">
                        <h4>⭐ Fun Fact!</h4>
                        <p>HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. He created it while working at CERN (a scientific research center in Switzerland) to help scientists share research papers. Now billions of people use HTML every day!</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>HTML Tags: The Building Blocks</h3>
                    <p>HTML uses "tags" to mark up content. Tags are like labels that tell the browser what kind of content it's looking at. Most tags come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.</p>

                    <p>A tag looks like this: <code>&lt;tagname&gt;content goes here&lt;/tagname&gt;</code></p>

                    <p>The opening tag is <code>&lt;tagname&gt;</code> and the closing tag is <code>&lt;/tagname&gt;</code> (notice the forward slash /). Everything between the opening and closing tags is affected by that tag.</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Basic HTML Tags</h4>
                        <p><code>&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Website&lt;/h1&gt;</code></p>
                        <p>This creates a big heading that says "Welcome to My Website"</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><code>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph of text.&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
                        <p>This creates a paragraph</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><code>&lt;strong&gt;This text is bold&lt;/strong&gt;</code></p>
                        <p>This makes text <strong>bold and important</strong></p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Common HTML Tags</h3>
                    <p>Let's learn some of the most important HTML tags you'll use:</p>

                    <h3>Basic HTML Page Structure</h3>
                    <p>Every HTML page follows the same basic structure. It's like the skeleton that all web pages are built on. Here's what a simple HTML page looks like:</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Complete HTML Page Structure</h4>
                        <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My First Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Page!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is my first website.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
                    </div>

                    <p>Let's break down what each part does:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</strong> - Tells the browser this is an HTML5 document (the newest version of HTML)</li>
                        <li><strong>&lt;html&gt;</strong> - The root element that wraps all the HTML code</li>
                        <li><strong>&lt;head&gt;</strong> - Contains information about the page (like the title) that doesn't show on the page itself</li>
                        <li><strong>&lt;title&gt;</strong> - Sets the title that appears in the browser tab</li>
                        <li><strong>&lt;body&gt;</strong> - Contains all the content that actually appears on the page</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="important-note">
                        <h4>📌 Important Structure Rules</h4>
                        <p>Every HTML page MUST have these elements in this order: &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;, &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, and &lt;body&gt;. Think of it like building a house - you need a foundation (DOCTYPE), walls (html), a roof plan (head), and the inside rooms (body)!</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>HTML Attributes</h3>
                    <p>Attributes give extra information about HTML elements. They go inside the opening tag and usually come in name="value" pairs. Let's look at some important attributes:</p>

                    <h4>The href Attribute (for links)</h4>
                    <p><code>&lt;a href="https://www.google.com"&gt;Go to Google&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>
                    <p>The <code>href</code> attribute tells the link where to go when you click it.</p>

                    <h4>The src Attribute (for images)</h4>
                    <p><code>&lt;img src="beach.jpg" alt="Jamaica beach"&gt;</code></p>
                    <p>The <code>src</code> attribute tells the browser which image file to display.</p>

                    <h4>The alt Attribute (for images)</h4>
                    <p>The <code>alt</code> attribute provides alternative text that describes the image. This helps people who can't see the image (like those using screen readers) and shows if the image doesn't load.</p>

                    <h3>Creating Lists in HTML</h3>
                    <p>Lists are very useful for organizing information. HTML has two main types of lists:</p>

                    <h4>Unordered Lists (Bulleted)</h4>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Unordered List</h4>
                        <pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ackee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Saltfish&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bammy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>
                        <p><strong>Displays as:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ackee</li>
                            <li>Saltfish</li>
                            <li>Bammy</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h4>Ordered Lists (Numbered)</h4>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Ordered List</h4>
                        <pre><code>&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wake up&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brush teeth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eat breakfast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</code></pre>
                        <p><strong>Displays as:</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Wake up</li>
                            <li>Brush teeth</li>
                            <li>Eat breakfast</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Creating Links</h3>
                    <p>Links are what make the web a "web!" They let you jump from one page to another. The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag (which stands for "anchor") creates links:</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Different Types of Links</h4>
                        <p><strong>Link to another website:</strong></p>
                        <p><code>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com"&gt;Visit YouTube&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Link to another page on your site:</strong></p>
                        <p><code>&lt;a href="about.html"&gt;About Me&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Link that opens in a new tab:</strong></p>
                        <p><code>&lt;a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Adding Images</h3>
                    <p>Images make web pages more interesting and beautiful! The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag adds images to your page. Notice that <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> doesn't have a closing tag - it's one of the few "self-closing" tags.</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Image Tag</h4>
                        <p><code>&lt;img src="jamaica-flag.jpg" alt="Flag of Jamaica" width="300"&gt;</code></p>
                        <p>This displays an image called "jamaica-flag.jpg" that's 300 pixels wide. The alt text "Flag of Jamaica" describes the image.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="experiment-box">

    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
                        <ol start="3">
                            <li>Fill in your information in the brackets</li>
                            <li>Save the file as "about.html" (make sure it ends in .html)</li>

                            <li>You just created your first web page! 🎉</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Try adding more HTML tags! Can you add:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Another heading (&lt;h2&gt; or &lt;h3&gt;)?</li>
                            <li>A link to your favorite website (&lt;a&gt;)?</li>
                            <li>A numbered list of your goals (&lt;ol&gt;)?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h3>HTML Comments</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes you want to write notes in your HTML code that won't show up on the web page. These are called "comments." Comments help you remember what your code does or leave notes for other people reading your code.</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: HTML Comments</h4>
                        <p><code>&lt;!-- This is a comment. It won't show on the page --&gt;</code></p>
                        <p><code>&lt;p&gt;This paragraph will show.&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
                        <p><code>&lt;!-- This paragraph is commented out, so it won't show --&gt;</code></p>
                        <p><code>&lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;Hidden paragraph&lt;/p&gt; --&gt;</code></p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Semantic HTML: Using Tags That Make Sense</h3>
                    <p>Modern HTML includes "semantic" tags - tags that describe their meaning. These make your code easier to understand and help with accessibility. Here are some useful semantic tags:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>&lt;header&gt;</strong> - The top section of a page (usually contains logo, navigation)</li>
                        <li><strong>&lt;nav&gt;</strong> - Navigation links</li>
                        <li><strong>&lt;main&gt;</strong> - The main content of the page</li>
                        <li><strong>&lt;article&gt;</strong> - A self-contained piece of content</li>
                        <li><strong>&lt;section&gt;</strong> - A section of related content</li>
                        <li><strong>&lt;footer&gt;</strong> - The bottom section of a page (usually contains copyright, contact info)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="fun-fact">
                        <h4>⭐ Fun Fact!</h4>
                        <p>The very first website ever created is still online! It was made by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 and just contained simple text explaining what the World Wide Web is. You can still visit it today!</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Advanced HTML: More Tags and Features</h3>
                    <p>Now that you know the basics, let's explore more HTML tags that make your websites even better!</p>

                    <h4>Creating Tables in HTML</h4>
                    <p>Tables organize information into rows and columns - perfect for displaying data!</p>

                            <li><code>&lt;table&gt;</code> - Creates the table</li>
                            <li><code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> - Table Row</li>
                            <li><code>&lt;th&gt;</code> - Table Header (bold and centered)</li>
                            <li><code>&lt;td&gt;</code> - Table Data (regular cell)</li>

                    <h3>HTML Best Practices</h3>
                    <p>Follow these tips to write clean, professional HTML code:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Use Proper Indentation:</strong> Indent nested elements to make code easier to read
                            <pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is indented&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This is indented more&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Use Lowercase Tags:</strong> Write <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> not <code>&lt;HTML&gt;</code></li>
                        <li><strong>Always Close Tags:</strong> Every opening tag needs a closing tag (except self-closing ones)</li>
                        <li><strong>Use Semantic HTML:</strong> Use <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, etc. instead of just <code>&lt;div&gt;</code></li>
                        <li><strong>Add Alt Text to Images:</strong> Always include <code>alt</code> attributes for accessibility</li>
                        <li><strong>Use Comments:</strong> <code>&lt;!-- comment --&gt;</code> to explain your code</li>
                        <li><strong>Validate Your HTML:</strong> Use online validators to check for errors</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>📌 Chapter 4: Styling with CSS</h2>

                    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
                    <p>CSS stands for <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>. While HTML creates the structure and content of a webpage, CSS makes it look beautiful! CSS controls colors, fonts, spacing, layouts, and all the visual design of a website.</p>

                    <p>Think of building a website like building a house: HTML is the structure (walls, doors, windows), and CSS is the decoration (paint colors, furniture, curtains). Without CSS, all websites would look plain and boring - just black text on a white background!</p>

                    <p>The "Cascading" part of CSS means that styles can flow down from parent elements to child elements, and later rules can override earlier ones. Don't worry if that sounds confusing - you'll understand it better as we learn more!</p>

                    <div class="fun-fact">
                        <h4>⭐ Fun Fact!</h4>
                        <p>CSS was invented by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994. Before CSS, you had to use HTML to style pages, which made the code messy and hard to maintain. CSS separated style from structure, making web development much easier!</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>How to Add CSS to HTML</h3>
                    <p>There are three ways to add CSS to your HTML pages:</p>

                    <h4>1. Inline CSS (Inside the HTML tag)</h4>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Inline CSS</h4>
                        <p><code>&lt;p style="color: blue; font-size: 20px;"&gt;This text is blue and big!&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
                        <p>Inline CSS uses the <code>style</code> attribute directly in the HTML tag. This is quick but not recommended for large projects because it's hard to maintain.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>2. Internal CSS (In the &lt;head&gt; section)</h4>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Internal CSS</h4>
                        <pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;
    p {
      color: blue;
      font-size: 20px;
    }
  &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</code></pre>
                        <p>Internal CSS goes inside a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section. This affects all matching elements on that page.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>3. External CSS (Separate CSS file) - BEST METHOD!</h4>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: External CSS</h4>
                        <p><strong>In your HTML file (in the &lt;head&gt; section):</strong></p>
                        <p><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;</code></p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>In your style.css file:</strong></p>
                        <pre><code>p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 20px;
}</code></pre>
                        <p>External CSS is the best method! You create a separate .css file and link to it from your HTML. This lets you use the same styles across multiple pages.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>CSS Syntax: How to Write CSS Rules</h3>
                    <p>CSS is made up of "rules." Each rule has two parts: a selector (what you want to style) and a declaration block (how you want to style it).</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: CSS Rule Structure</h4>
                        <pre><code>selector {
  property: value;
  property: value;
}</code></pre>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                        <pre><code>h1 {
  color: red;
  font-size: 36px;
  text-align: center;
}</code></pre>
                        <p>This makes all <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> headings red, 36 pixels big, and centered!</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Let's break down the parts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Selector</strong> - Tells CSS which HTML elements to style (like <code>h1</code>, <code>p</code>, or <code>div</code>)</li>
                        <li><strong>Property</strong> - What aspect you want to change (like <code>color</code>, <code>font-size</code>, <code>background</code>)</li>
                        <li><strong>Value</strong> - What you want to change it to (like <code>red</code>, <code>36px</code>, <code>center</code>)</li>
                        <li><strong>Curly braces { }</strong> - Contain all the property-value pairs</li>
                        <li><strong>Semicolon ;</strong> - Ends each property-value pair</li>

                    <h3>CSS Selectors: Choosing What to Style</h3>
                    <p>Selectors are super important! They let you target specific elements to style. Here are the most common types:</p>

                    <h4>1. Element Selector (Tag Name)</h4>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Element Selector</h4>
                        <pre><code>p {
  color: green;
}</code></pre>
                        <p>This styles ALL paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) elements on the page.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>2. Class Selector (Starts with a dot .)</h4>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Class Selector</h4>
                        <p><strong>In CSS:</strong></p>
                        <pre><code>.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
}</code></pre>
                        <p><strong>In HTML:</strong></p>
                        <p><code>&lt;p class="highlight"&gt;This paragraph is highlighted!&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
                        <p>The class selector lets you style specific elements. You can use the same class on multiple elements!</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>3. ID Selector (Starts with a hash #)</h4>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: ID Selector</h4>
                        <p><strong>In CSS:</strong></p>
                        <pre><code>#main-title {
  color: purple;
  font-size: 48px;
}</code></pre>
                        <p><strong>In HTML:</strong></p>
                        <p><code>&lt;h1 id="main-title"&gt;Welcome!&lt;/h1&gt;</code></p>
                        <p>IDs are unique - you should only use each ID once per page.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="important-note">
                        <h4>📌 Class vs ID: What's the Difference?</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Class (.classname)</strong> - Can be used on multiple elements. Like a label that many things can share.</li>
                            <li><strong>ID (#idname)</strong> - Should only be used once per page. Like a unique name for one special element.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Generally, use classes for styling and IDs for unique elements or JavaScript targeting.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Working with Colors in CSS</h3>
                    <p>CSS gives you many ways to specify colors:</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Different Ways to Specify Colors</h4>
                        <p><strong>1. Color Names:</strong> (140 color names available)</p>
                        <p><code>color: red;</code></p>
                        <p><code>color: forestgreen;</code></p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>2. Hex Codes:</strong> (# followed by 6 characters)</p>
                        <p><code>color: #FF0000;</code> (red)</p>
                        <p><code>color: #00A651;</code> (Jamaican green!)</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>3. RGB:</strong> (Red, Green, Blue values 0-255)</p>
                        <p><code>color: rgb(255, 0, 0);</code> (red)</p>
                        <p><code>color: rgb(0, 166, 81);</code> (Jamaican green!)</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>4. RGBA:</strong> (RGB + Alpha for transparency)</p>
                        <p><code>color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);</code> (semi-transparent red)</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>The Box Model: Understanding Spacing</h3>
                    <p>Every HTML element is like a box. The "box model" helps you control spacing around and inside elements. It has four parts:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Content</strong> - The actual text or image</li>
                        <li><strong>Padding</strong> - Space between content and border (inside the box)</li>
                        <li><strong>Border</strong> - A line around the padding</li>
                        <li><strong>Margin</strong> - Space outside the border (between this box and others)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Box Model Properties</h4>
                        <pre><code>div {
  /* Content area */
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;

  /* Padding (space inside) */
  padding: 20px;

  /* Border */
  border: 2px solid black;

  /* Margin (space outside) */
  margin: 10px;

  /* Background color */
  background-color: lightblue;
}</code></pre>
                    </div>

                    <h4>Margin and Padding Shortcuts</h4>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Margin/Padding Shortcuts</h4>
                        <p><strong>All sides the same:</strong></p>
                        <p><code>margin: 20px;</code> (20px on all sides)</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Top/Bottom and Left/Right:</strong></p>
                        <p><code>margin: 20px 40px;</code> (20px top/bottom, 40px left/right)</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Top, Right, Bottom, Left (clockwise):</strong></p>
                        <p><code>margin: 10px 20px 30px 40px;</code></p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Individual sides:</strong></p>
                        <p><code>margin-top: 10px;</code></p>
                        <p><code>margin-right: 20px;</code></p>
                        <p><code>margin-bottom: 30px;</code></p>

                    <h3>Borders in CSS</h3>
                    <p>Borders add lines around elements. You can control their width, style, and color:</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Border Styles</h4>
                        <pre><code>/* Complete border */
border: 3px solid red;

/* Border on specific sides */
border-top: 2px dashed blue;
border-right: 1px dotted green;

/* Rounded corners */
border-radius: 10px;

/* Circular element */
border-radius: 50%;</code></pre>
                        <p>Border styles include: solid, dashed, dotted, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset, none</p>

                    <h3>Advanced CSS Layout: Flexbox</h3>
                    <p>Flexbox is a powerful layout system that makes it easy to arrange items in rows or columns!</p>

                    <h4>What is Flexbox?</h4>
                    <p>Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) lets you create flexible, responsive layouts without using complex positioning or floating. It's perfect for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Creating navigation menus</li>
                        <li>Arranging cards or items in a row</li>
                        <li>Centering content vertically and horizontally</li>
                        <li>Creating equal-height columns</li>
                        <li>Building responsive galleries</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Flex Container Properties</h4>
                    <p>When you make an element a flex container with <code>display: flex;</code>, you can control how its children are arranged:</p>

                    <div class="example-box">

                    <h2>📌 Chapter 5: JavaScript Magic</h2>

                    <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
                    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that makes websites interactive and dynamic! While HTML creates the structure and CSS makes it look pretty, JavaScript makes things happen. It lets you create games, animations, interactive forms, and so much more!</p>

                    <p>Think of building a website like building a robot: HTML is the body structure, CSS is the paint and decoration, and JavaScript is the brain that makes it move and do things. JavaScript brings your website to life!</p>

                    <p>JavaScript runs in your web browser, which means it works on the user's computer without needing to connect to a server. This makes websites fast and responsive. Almost every modern website uses JavaScript - from Google to Facebook to YouTube!</p>

                    <div class="fun-fact">
                        <h4>⭐ Fun Fact!</h4>
                        <p>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in just 10 days in 1995! Despite the name, JavaScript is not related to Java - they're completely different languages. The name was chosen for marketing reasons because Java was popular at the time!</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>How to Add JavaScript to HTML</h3>
                    <p>Just like CSS, there are different ways to add JavaScript to your webpage:</p>

                    <h4>1. Inline JavaScript (Inside HTML tags)</h4>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Inline JavaScript</h4>
                        <p><code>&lt;button onclick="alert('Hello!')"&gt;Click Me!&lt;/button&gt;</code></p>
                        <p>This creates a button that shows a popup message when clicked.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>2. Internal JavaScript (In &lt;script&gt; tags)</h4>

                    <h4>3. External JavaScript (Separate JS file) - BEST METHOD!</h4>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: External JavaScript</h4>
                        <p><strong>In your HTML file (before &lt;/body&gt;):</strong></p>

                    <h3>JavaScript Basics: Variables</h3>
                    <p>Variables are like containers that store information. You can put data into variables and use them later in your program. In JavaScript, we create variables using <code>let</code>, <code>const</code>, or <code>var</code>.</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Creating Variables</h4>
                        <pre><code>// Using let (can change later)
let studentName = "Marcus";
let age = 11;
let score = 95.5;

// Using const (cannot change - constant)
const schoolName = "Jamaica Primary School";
const pi = 3.14159;

// Changing a let variable
age = 12; // Marcus had a birthday!

// This would cause an error:
// schoolName = "Different School"; // ERROR! Can't change const</code></pre>
                    </div>

                    <div class="important-note">
                        <h4>📌 When to Use let vs const</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>let</strong> - Use when the value might change (like age, score, username)</li>
                            <li><strong>const</strong> - Use when the value should never change (like pi, your birthday, school name)</li>
                            <li><strong>var</strong> - Old way (avoid using this in new code)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Functions: Reusable Code Blocks</h3>
                    <p>Functions are like recipes - they're sets of instructions you can use over and over! You define a function once, then "call" it whenever you need it.</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Creating and Using Functions</h4>
                        <pre><code>// Function without parameters
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, Jamaica!");
}

// Call the function
sayHello(); // Outputs: "Hello, Jamaica!"

// Function with parameters
function greetStudent(name) {
  console.log("Welcome, " + name + "!");
}

greetStudent("Marcus"); // Outputs: "Welcome, Marcus!"
greetStudent("Shanice"); // Outputs: "Welcome, Shanice!"

// Function that returns a value
function addNumbers(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;

let sum = addNumbers(5, 3); // sum = 8
let total = addNumbers(10, 20); // total = 30</code></pre>

                    <h3>Conditional Statements: Making Decisions</h3>
                    <p>Conditional statements let your program make decisions based on conditions. The main ones are <code>if</code>, <code>else if</code>, and <code>else</code>.</p>

                    <p>Loops let you repeat code multiple times without writing it over and over. The main loops are <code>for</code> loops and <code>while</code> loops.</p>

                    <div class="example-box">

// Number: 2
// Number: 3
// Number: 4
// Number: 5

// Loop through an array

                        <p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We use <code>setInterval()</code> to run code every 1 second (1000ms)</li>
                            <li>Each second, we decrease <code>timeLeft</code> by 1</li>
                            <li>When it reaches 0, we show "BLAST OFF!" and stop the timer</li>
                            <li>The reset button clears the interval and resets to 10</li>
                            <li>We disable the start button while countdown is running</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Challenges to Try:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Change the starting number to 30</li>
                            <li>Add sound effects (look up HTML Audio API)</li>
                            <li>Make the numbers change color as they get closer to 0</li>
                            <li>Add a "Pause" button</li>
                            <li>Create an input field where users can set their own countdown time</li>

                            <li><code>Math.floor()</code> rounds down to remove decimals</li>
                            <li>We store all guesses in an array to show history</li>
                            <li>We give different hints based on how close the guess is</li>

                        <h4>💡 Example: Using localStorage</h4>
                        <pre><code>// Save data
localStorage.setItem('username', 'Marcus');
localStorage.setItem('score', '100');

// Get data
let username = localStorage.getItem('username');
console.log(username); // "Marcus"

// Remove data
localStorage.removeItem('score');

// Clear all data
localStorage.clear();

// Save complex data (objects/arrays) - must use JSON
let student = {
  name: 'Shanice',
  grade: 6,
  scores: [85, 92, 78]
};

// Convert to string before saving
localStorage.setItem('student', JSON.stringify(student));

// Convert back to object when retrieving
let savedStudent = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('student'));
console.log(savedStudent.name); // "Shanice"</code></pre>
                    </div>

                    <div class="important-note">
                        <h4>📌 Important Notes About localStorage</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>localStorage only stores strings - use JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() for objects</li>
                            <li>Data persists even after closing the browser</li>
                            <li>Each website has its own separate localStorage</li>
                            <li>Limited to about 5-10MB of data per domain</li>
                            <li>Always check if data exists before using it: <code>if (localStorage.getItem('key'))</code></li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Template Literals: Modern String Formatting</h3>
                    <p>Template literals make it easier to create strings with variables and expressions!</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Template Literals</h4>
                        <pre><code>// Old way with concatenation
let name = "Marcus";
let age = 12;
let message = "Hello, my name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.";

// New way with template literals (use backticks `)
let betterMessage = `Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;

// Multi-line strings are easy
let poem = `Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
JavaScript is awesome,
And so are you!`;

// Expressions inside ${}
let price = 100;
let tax = 15;
let total = `Total cost: $${price + tax}`;

// Calling functions
function getGrade(score) {
  return score >= 90 ? 'A' : score >= 80 ? 'B' : 'C';
}

let score = 85;
let report = `Your score is ${score}. You got a ${getGrade(score)}!`;
console.log(report); // "Your score is 85. You got a B!"</code></pre>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Destructuring: Extracting Values Easily</h3>
                    <p>Destructuring lets you extract values from arrays and objects quickly!</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Destructuring</h4>
                        <pre><code>// Array destructuring
let colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
let [first, second, third] = colors;
console.log(first); // "red"
console.log(second); // "green"

// Skip values
let [primary, , tertiary] = colors;
console.log(tertiary); // "blue"

// Object destructuring
let student = {
  name: 'Kayla',
  age: 11,
  grade: 6,
  school: 'Kingston Primary'
};

let {name, age, grade} = student;
console.log(name); // "Kayla"
console.log(age); // 11

// Rename variables
let {name: studentName, grade: studentGrade} = student;
console.log(studentName); // "Kayla"

// Default values
let {name: n, country = 'Jamaica'} = student;
console.log(country); // "Jamaica" (default, since not in object)</code></pre>

                    <h2>📌 Chapter 6: Electrical Components</h2>

                    <h3>Understanding Electricity</h3>
                    <p>Electricity is a form of energy that powers almost everything in our modern world - from lights and computers to refrigerators and phones! Before we learn about electrical components, let's understand what electricity is.</p>

                    <p>Electricity is the flow of tiny particles called electrons. Think of it like water flowing through pipes - the electrons flow through wires! When electrons move together in the same direction, we call that an electric current.</p>

                    <p>There are two types of electricity:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Static Electricity:</strong> When electric charges build up in one place (like when you rub a balloon on your hair and it sticks)</li>
                        <li><strong>Current Electricity:</strong> When electric charges flow continuously through a conductor (like the electricity that powers your home)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="fun-fact">
                        <h4>⭐ Fun Fact!</h4>
                        <p>Lightning is a giant spark of static electricity! A single bolt of lightning can contain up to one billion volts of electricity - that's enough power to toast 100,000 slices of bread!</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Basic Electrical Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Let's learn three important electrical concepts that work together:</p>

                    <h4>Voltage (V) - The Push</h4>
                    <p>Voltage is the "push" that makes electricity flow. It's measured in volts (V). Think of voltage like water pressure in a hose - higher pressure pushes water faster. Higher voltage pushes electrons faster through a wire.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>AA battery: 1.5 volts</li>
                        <li>Phone charger: 5 volts</li>
                        <li>Wall outlet in Jamaica: 110-120 volts</li>
                        <li>Car battery: 12 volts</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Current (I) - The Flow</h4>
                    <p>Current is how much electricity is flowing. It's measured in amperes or amps (A). Using our water analogy, current is like how much water flows through the hose per second.</p>

                    <h4>Resistance (R) - The Opposition</h4>
                    <p>Resistance is anything that slows down the flow of electricity. It's measured in ohms (Ω). In our water analogy, resistance is like a narrow section in the hose that slows the water down.</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Ohm's Law: The Relationship</h4>
                        <p>These three concepts are connected by Ohm's Law:</p>
                        <p><strong>Voltage = Current × Resistance</strong></p>
                        <p>Or: V = I × R</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Example: If you have a 9-volt battery (V = 9) and a resistance of 3 ohms (R = 3), the current would be:</p>
                        <p>I = V ÷ R = 9 ÷ 3 = 3 amps</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Conductors and Insulators</h3>
                    <p>Materials can be divided into two main groups based on how well they let electricity flow:</p>

                    <h4>Conductors - Let Electricity Flow Easily</h4>
                    <p>Conductors are materials that allow electricity to flow through them easily. Most metals are good conductors.</p>

                        </tr>
                    </table>

                    <h4>Insulators - Block Electricity</h4>
                    <p>Insulators are materials that don't let electricity flow through them. They protect us from electric shocks!</p>

                    <div class="important-note">
                        <h4>📌 Safety Warning!</h4>
                        <p>NEVER experiment with electricity from wall outlets or high-voltage sources! Only use batteries (AA, AAA, 9V) for experiments, and always have adult supervision. Electricity can be dangerous and even deadly!</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Common Electrical Components</h3>
                    <p>Let's explore the building blocks of electrical circuits!</p>

                    <h4>1. Battery - Power Source</h4>
                    <p>A battery stores chemical energy and converts it to electrical energy. It has two terminals:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Positive (+)</strong> - Usually marked with a plus sign, longer terminal</li>
                        <li><strong>Negative (-)</strong> - Usually marked with a minus sign, shorter terminal</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Electricity flows from the negative terminal, through the circuit, and back to the positive terminal.</p>

                    <h4>2. Wire/Conductor - Path for Electricity</h4>
                    <p>Wires carry electricity from one component to another. They're usually made of copper and covered with plastic insulation for safety. The plastic protects you from touching the conductive metal inside.</p>

                    <h4>3. Switch - On/Off Control</h4>
                    <p>A switch opens or closes a circuit. When closed, electricity can flow (ON). When open, the circuit is broken and electricity can't flow (OFF). Think of it like a drawbridge - when down (closed), cars can cross; when up (open), they can't!</p>

                    <h4>4. LED (Light Emitting Diode) - Light Source</h4>
                    <p>An LED is a small, efficient light. Unlike regular light bulbs, LEDs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use very little power</li>
                        <li>Don't get hot</li>
                        <li>Last a very long time (years!)</li>
                        <li>Come in many colors</li>
                        <li>Only work one way (they have polarity)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>LEDs have two legs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Longer leg (Anode)</strong> - Connects to positive (+)</li>
                        <li><strong>Shorter leg (Cathode)</strong> - Connects to negative (-)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="important-note">
                        <h4>📌 LED Direction Matters!</h4>
                        <p>If you connect an LED backwards, it won't light up! Always connect the long leg to positive and the short leg to negative. You can remember: Long = Light (positive makes it light up!).</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>5. Resistor - Current Limiter</h4>
                    <p>A resistor reduces the flow of electricity in a circuit. Resistors are important because they:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Protect components (like LEDs) from too much current</li>
                        <li>Control brightness of LEDs</li>
                        <li>Divide voltage in circuits</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Resistors are measured in ohms (Ω). Common values include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>100Ω (100 ohms)</li>
                        <li>220Ω (220 ohms) - good for LEDs with 5V</li>
                        <li>1kΩ (1,000 ohms or 1 kiloohm)</li>
                        <li>10kΩ (10,000 ohms or 10 kiloohms)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Resistors have colored bands that tell you their value! Learning to read resistor color codes is like learning a secret language of electronics.</p>

                    <h4>6. Buzzer - Sound Maker</h4>
                    <p>A buzzer creates sound when electricity flows through it. Some buzzers have polarity (positive and negative matter), while others work either way.</p>

                    <h4>7. Motor - Creates Motion</h4>
                    <p>An electric motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy (motion). When electricity flows through a motor, it spins! Motors are used in fans, toys, robots, and countless other devices.</p>

                    <h3>Electric Circuits</h3>
                    <p>A circuit is a complete path that electricity can flow through. For electricity to flow, the circuit must be complete - it needs a loop from the power source through components and back to the power source.</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Simple LED Circuit</h4>
                        <p>A basic LED circuit needs:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Battery (power source) - provides energy</li>
                            <li>Resistor (220Ω) - limits current to protect LED</li>
                            <li>LED - produces light</li>
                            <li>Wires - connect everything together</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Connection order:</strong></p>
                        <p>Battery (+) → Resistor → LED (long leg) → LED (short leg) → Battery (-)</p>

                    <h4>Types of Circuits</h4>
                    <p>There are two main ways to connect components in a circuit:</p>

                    <p><strong>Series Circuit:</strong> Components are connected one after another in a single path. If one component fails, the whole circuit stops working (like old Christmas lights!).</p>

                    <p><strong>Parallel Circuit:</strong> Components are connected on separate branches. If one component fails, the others keep working (like modern Christmas lights and home wiring).</p>

                    <h3>Advanced Components: Capacitors</h3>
                    <p>A capacitor stores electrical energy temporarily, like a tiny rechargeable battery. It charges up quickly and releases energy quickly too!</p>

                    <h4>How Capacitors Work</h4>
                    <p>Think of a capacitor like a water balloon:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When you turn on the water (electricity), it fills up (stores charge)</li>
                        <li>When full, it can release the water quickly (discharge)</li>
                        <li>The bigger the balloon, the more water (charge) it can hold</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Capacitors are measured in farads (F), but most capacitors are tiny:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 µF (microfarad) = 0.000001 farads</li>
                        <li>1 nF (nanofarad) = 0.000000001 farads</li>
                        <li>1 pF (picofarad) = 0.000000000001 farads</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li><strong>Switch:</strong> Turn current on or off</li>
                        <li><strong>Amplifier:</strong> Make weak signals stronger</li>
                        <li><strong>Logic Gate:</strong> Make decisions (used in computer processors)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>A transistor has three legs (terminals):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Base:</strong> The control leg (like a switch button)</li>
                        <li><strong>Collector:</strong> Where current enters</li>
                        <li><strong>Emitter:</strong> Where current exits</li>
                    </ul>

                        <h4>⭐ Fun Fact!</h4>
                        <p>The first transistor was invented in 1947 and was the size of your hand! Today, a modern computer processor has over 50 BILLION transistors, and they're so small that thousands would fit on the head of a pin! Your phone has more computing power than all of NASA had when they sent astronauts to the moon!</p>

                    <h2>📌 Chapter 7: Input & Output Devices</h2>

                    <h3>Understanding Input and Output</h3>
                    <p>Computers need ways to receive information from us (input) and send information back to us (output). Input and output devices are the bridge between humans and computers - they let us communicate with machines!</p>

                    <p>Think of it like having a conversation: when you speak, that's input (you're giving information). When someone responds, that's output (you're receiving information). Computers work the same way with input and output devices.</p>

                    <div class="fun-fact">
                        <h4>⭐ Fun Fact!</h4>
                        <p>The first computer mouse was invented by Doug Engelbart in 1964. It was made of wood and had only one button! He called it a "mouse" because the cord coming out the back looked like a tail.</p>

                    <p>Ever wonder how input devices actually work? Let's peek inside!</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 How a Keyboard Works</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>You press a key</strong> - Your finger pushes down</li>
                            <li><strong>Circuit completes</strong> - Two contacts touch, completing an electrical circuit</li>
                            <li><strong>Signal sent</strong> - The keyboard controller detects which key was pressed</li>
                            <li><strong>Code generated</strong> - A special code (scan code) is created for that key</li>
                            <li><strong>Computer receives</strong> - The code is sent to the computer via USB cable or Bluetooth</li>
                            <li><strong>Character appears</strong> - The computer converts the code to the letter and displays it on screen</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>All this happens in milliseconds - faster than you can blink!</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 How a Mouse Works</h4>
                        <p><strong>Optical Mouse (Most Common):</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>LED shines</strong> - A red LED light shines down onto your desk</li>
                            <li><strong>Light bounces back</strong> - The light reflects off the desk surface</li>
                            <li><strong>Camera captures</strong> - A tiny camera (CMOS sensor) takes thousands of pictures per second</li>
                            <li><strong>Movement detected</strong> - The mouse compares pictures to detect movement direction and speed</li>
                            <li><strong>Cursor moves</strong> - Signals sent to computer to move cursor accordingly</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The mouse is essentially a tiny, super-fast camera!</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 How a Touchscreen Works</h4>
                        <p><strong>Capacitive Touchscreen (Phones/Tablets):</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Electric field</strong> - Screen has a grid of tiny electrodes creating an electric field</li>
                            <li><strong>You touch</strong> - Your finger disrupts the electric field (humans conduct electricity!)</li>
                            <li><strong>Change detected</strong> - Sensors measure where the field changed</li>
                            <li><strong>Location calculated</strong> - Computer calculates exact touch position</li>
                            <li><strong>Action performed</strong> - App responds to your touch</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This is why touchscreens don't work with regular gloves - they don't conduct electricity! Special "touchscreen gloves" have conductive material in the fingertips.</p>

                    <h3>How Output Devices Display Data</h3>
                    <p>Now let's see how output devices show you information!</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 How a Monitor Works</h4>
                        <p><strong>LCD/LED Monitor:</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Computer sends data</strong> - Graphics card sends image data via HDMI/DisplayPort</li>
                            <li><strong>Millions of pixels</strong> - Screen has millions of tiny pixels (picture elements)</li>
                            <li><strong>Each pixel has subpixels</strong> - Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) subpixels</li>
                            <li><strong>Liquid crystals twist</strong> - Electric current controls how much light passes through each subpixel</li>
                            <li><strong>Backlight shines</strong> - LED backlight illuminates from behind</li>
                            <li><strong>Colors combine</strong> - RGB subpixels mix to create any color</li>
                            <li><strong>You see image</strong> - Millions of pixels together form the image</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>A Full HD screen (1920x1080) has over 2 million pixels, each with 3 subpixels - that's over 6 million tiny color dots!</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 How Speakers Work</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Digital audio signal</strong> - Computer sends audio as digital data</li>
                            <li><strong>Converted to analog</strong> - Sound card converts digital to electrical waves</li>
                            <li><strong>Electromagnet activates</strong> - Electrical signal goes to speaker coil</li>
                            <li><strong>Magnet pushes/pulls</strong> - Electromagnet pushes and pulls against permanent magnet</li>
                            <li><strong>Cone vibrates</strong> - Speaker cone attached to coil vibrates back and forth</li>
                            <li><strong>Air vibrates</strong> - Cone pushes air, creating sound waves</li>
                            <li><strong>You hear sound</strong> - Sound waves reach your ears</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This happens thousands of times per second to create music and voices!</p>

                    <h2>📌 Chapter 8: How the Internet Works</h2>

                    <h3>What is the Internet?</h3>
                    <p>The Internet is a global network of connected computers that can share information with each other. It's like a giant web that connects billions of devices all around the world - computers, phones, tablets, and even smart appliances!</p>

                    <p>The word "Internet" comes from "interconnected networks." It's not just one thing - it's millions of smaller networks (like your school network, your home WiFi, company networks) all connected together. This lets a student in Jamaica send a message to someone in Japan in just seconds!</p>

                    <p>The Internet is often confused with the World Wide Web, but they're different:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The Internet</strong> - The physical network of cables, routers, and computers</li>
                        <li><strong>The Web (WWW)</strong> - Websites and web pages that exist ON the Internet</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Think of it like this: the Internet is like the road system, and the Web is like the houses and shops along those roads!</p>

                    <div class="fun-fact">
                        <h4>⭐ Fun Fact!</h4>
                        <p>The Internet started in 1969 as ARPANET, connecting just 4 computers at different universities in the United States. The first message ever sent was supposed to be "LOGIN" but the system crashed after just "LO"! Today, over 5 billion people use the Internet!</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>How Data Travels on the Internet</h3>
                    <p>When you send a message or load a website, your data doesn't travel in one piece. Instead, it's broken into tiny chunks called "packets." Here's how it works:</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Sending a Message</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>You type a message</strong> - "Hello friend!" on your computer</li>
                            <li><strong>Data is split into packets</strong> - The message breaks into tiny pieces</li>
                            <li><strong>Each packet gets an address</strong> - Like putting addresses on envelopes</li>
                            <li><strong>Packets travel independently</strong> - They might take different routes!</li>
                            <li><strong>Routers direct traffic</strong> - Special computers send packets the best way</li>
                            <li><strong>Packets arrive at destination</strong> - They might arrive out of order</li>
                            <li><strong>Packets are reassembled</strong> - Put back together in correct order</li>
                            <li><strong>Your friend sees "Hello friend!"</strong> - The complete message appears!</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>All of this happens in fractions of a second!</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Key Components of the Internet</h3>

                    <h4>1. Servers</h4>
                    <p>Servers are powerful computers that store and serve information. When you visit a website, you're connecting to a server. Servers run 24/7 and can handle thousands of requests at once. Major websites like Google and YouTube have huge data centers with thousands of servers!</p>

                    <h4>2. Clients</h4>
                    <p>A client is any device that requests information from a server. Your computer, phone, or tablet is a client when you browse the Internet. Clients ask questions ("Give me this website") and servers provide answers.</p>

                    <h4>3. Routers</h4>
                    <p>Routers are like traffic directors for the Internet. They receive data packets and decide the best path to send them. Your home WiFi router connects your devices to the Internet. Larger routers at Internet Service Providers (ISPs) connect thousands of homes and businesses.</p>

                    <h4>4. Internet Service Provider (ISP)</h4>
                    <p>An ISP is a company that provides you with Internet access. In Jamaica, ISPs include companies like Flow, Digicel, and others. They maintain the infrastructure (cables, cell towers, etc.) that connects you to the global Internet.</p>

                    <h4>5. Cables and Connections</h4>
                    <p>The Internet is physically connected by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Fiber optic cables</strong> - Glass cables that transmit data as light (very fast!)</li>
                        <li><strong>Copper cables</strong> - Traditional telephone and cable lines</li>
                        <li><strong>Undersea cables</strong> - Massive cables on the ocean floor connecting continents</li>
                        <li><strong>Satellites</strong> - Provide Internet to remote areas</li>
                        <li><strong>Cell towers</strong> - For mobile Internet (3G, 4G, 5G)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="important-note">
                        <h4>📌 The Internet is Physical!</h4>
                        <p>Even though we can't see it, the Internet exists in the real world! Huge cables cross oceans, data centers the size of warehouses store information, and satellites orbit Earth. When people talk about "the cloud," they really mean "someone else's computer" in a data center somewhere!</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>IP Addresses: The Internet's Addresses</h3>
                    <p>Every device on the Internet has a unique address called an IP address (Internet Protocol address). It's like a street address for your computer!</p>

                    <p>IP addresses come in two versions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>IPv4</strong> - Looks like: 192.168.1.1 (four numbers separated by dots)</li>
                        <li><strong>IPv6</strong> - Looks like: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 (longer, newer format)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>When you type a website name like "www.google.com," special servers called DNS (Domain Name System) servers translate that name into an IP address so your computer knows where to send the request.</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: DNS is Like a Phone Book</h4>
                        <p>Imagine you want to call your friend Marcus, but you don't remember his phone number. You look it up in your contacts:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Name:</strong> Marcus (easy to remember)</li>
                            <li><strong>Phone Number:</strong> 876-555-1234 (hard to remember)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>DNS works the same way:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Domain Name:</strong> www.google.com (easy to remember)</li>
                            <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> 172.217.164.46 (hard to remember)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>DNS servers translate the easy name into the actual IP address!</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Web Browsers: Your Window to the Internet</h3>
                    <p>A web browser is software that lets you access and view websites. Popular browsers include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Google Chrome</li>
                        <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
                        <li>Safari (on Apple devices)</li>
                        <li>Microsoft Edge</li>
                        <li>Brave</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>When you type a website address (URL) into a browser, here's what happens:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Browser asks DNS: "What's the IP address for this website?"</li>
                        <li>DNS responds with the IP address</li>
                        <li>Browser connects to that IP address</li>
                        <li>Browser requests the website's files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images)</li>
                        <li>Server sends the files back</li>
                        <li>Browser displays the website on your screen</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>URLs: Website Addresses</h3>
                    <p>URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator - it's the address of a resource on the Internet. Let's break down a URL:</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Understanding URLs</h4>
                        <p><strong>https://www.example.com/page.html?id=123</strong></p>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>https://</strong> - Protocol (how to communicate) - "s" means secure</li>
                            <li><strong>www</strong> - Subdomain (optional)</li>
                            <li><strong>example.com</strong> - Domain name (the website)</li>
                            <li><strong>/page.html</strong> - Path (specific page on the website)</li>
                            <li><strong>?id=123</strong> - Parameters (extra information)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h3>How Websites Work</h3>
                    <p>A website is a collection of web pages stored on a server. When you visit a website:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Your browser requests the HTML file</li>
                        <li>The HTML file references CSS (styling) and JavaScript (interactivity)</li>
                        <li>Browser requests those additional files</li>
                        <li>Browser requests any images, videos, or other media</li>
                        <li>Browser puts everything together and displays the page</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>This is called the "client-server model" - your device (client) asks for information, and the server provides it.</p>

                    <h3>Internet Speed and Bandwidth</h3>
                    <p>Internet speed is measured in bits per second:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Kbps</strong> - Kilobits per second (1,000 bits)</li>
                        <li><strong>Mbps</strong> - Megabits per second (1,000,000 bits) - common for home Internet</li>
                        <li><strong>Gbps</strong> - Gigabits per second (1,000,000,000 bits) - very fast connections</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Bandwidth</strong> is like the width of a pipe - the wider the pipe, the more water (data) can flow through at once!</p>

                            <td>Large families, heavy usage, fast downloads</td>
                        </tr>

                    <h3>Staying Safe Online</h3>
                    <p>The Internet is amazing, but it's important to stay safe! Here are key safety rules:</p>

                    <h4>Cybersecurity Basics</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Use strong passwords</strong> - Mix letters, numbers, and symbols. Don't use the same password everywhere!</li>
                        <li><strong>Don't share personal information</strong> - Never share your full name, address, phone number, or school name with strangers online</li>
                        <li><strong>Think before you click</strong> - Don't click suspicious links or download files from unknown sources</li>
                        <li><strong>Keep software updated</strong> - Updates often include security fixes</li>
                        <li><strong>Use antivirus software</strong> - Protects against malware and viruses</li>
                        <li><strong>Check for HTTPS</strong> - Look for the padlock icon in the address bar on websites</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Social Media Safety</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep your profiles private</li>
                        <li>Only accept friend requests from people you know in real life</li>
                        <li>Think before you post - anything online can be there forever!</li>
                        <li>Report cyberbullying to a trusted adult</li>
                        <li>Don't meet online friends in person without adult supervision</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Recognizing Online Dangers</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Phishing</strong> - Fake emails or messages trying to steal your information</li>
                        <li><strong>Malware</strong> - Harmful software that can damage your device</li>
                        <li><strong>Scams</strong> - Tricks to get your money or information</li>
                        <li><strong>Cyberbullying</strong> - Mean or hurtful behavior online</li>
                        <li><strong>Inappropriate content</strong> - Material not suitable for children</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="important-note">
                        <h4>📌 The Golden Rule of Internet Safety</h4>

                    <h3>What are Digital Tools and Apps?</h3>
                    <p>Digital tools and applications (apps) are software programs that help us do specific tasks on computers, tablets, and smartphones. They make our digital devices useful and powerful!</p>

                    <p>Think of apps like tools in a toolbox - each one has a special job. Just like you use a hammer to put in nails and a screwdriver to turn screws, you use different apps for different tasks: one for writing, one for math, one for drawing, and so on.</p>

                    <p>The word "app" is short for "application." Apps can be:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Desktop applications</strong> - Run on computers (like Microsoft Word)</li>
                        <li><strong>Mobile apps</strong> - Run on phones and tablets (like Instagram or games)</li>
                        <li><strong>Web apps</strong> - Run in a browser without installing (like Google Docs)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="fun-fact">
                        <h4>⭐ Fun Fact!</h4>
                        <p>The Apple App Store launched in 2008 with only 500 apps. Today there are over 1.8 million apps available! The Google Play Store has over 3 million apps. People have downloaded apps over 200 billion times!</p>

                    <h2>📌 Chapter 10: Coding Concepts</h2>

                    <h3>What is Coding?</h3>
                    <p>Coding (also called programming) is writing instructions that computers can understand and follow. Just like you follow a recipe to bake a cake, computers follow code to perform tasks. When you code, you're telling a computer exactly what to do, step by step!</p>

                    <p>Everything digital runs on code - video games, websites, apps, smart TVs, even traffic lights! Coders (programmers) create this code using special languages that computers understand. Learning to code is like learning a new language, but instead of talking to people, you're talking to machines!</p>

                    <p>The best part? Coding lets you create anything you can imagine - games, art, music, websites, robots, and more!</p>

                    <div class="fun-fact">
                        <h4>⭐ Fun Fact!</h4>
                        <p>The first computer programmer was Ada Lovelace in the 1840s - almost 100 years before modern computers existed! She wrote instructions for Charles Babbage's "Analytical Engine." Today, programming languages are named after her (Ada) and other pioneers!</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Core Concepts of Programming</h3>
                    <p>No matter what programming language you use, certain concepts appear in all of them. Let's learn these fundamental ideas!</p>

                    <h4>1. Algorithms: Step-by-Step Instructions</h4>
                    <p>An algorithm is a set of steps to solve a problem or complete a task. You use algorithms every day without realizing it!</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Algorithm for Making a Sandwich</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Get two slices of bread</li>
                            <li>Open the jar of peanut butter</li>
                            <li>Spread peanut butter on one slice</li>
                            <li>Open the jar of jam</li>
                            <li>Spread jam on the other slice</li>
                            <li>Put the two slices together</li>
                            <li>Enjoy your sandwich!</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This is an algorithm! It's clear, step-by-step, and anyone can follow it.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Good algorithms are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Clear</strong> - Easy to understand</li>
                        <li><strong>Correct</strong> - Solves the problem accurately</li>
                        <li><strong>Efficient</strong> - Solves the problem quickly</li>
                        <li><strong>Complete</strong> - Covers all possible situations</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>2. Variables: Storing Information</h4>
                    <p>Variables are like labeled boxes that store information. You can put data in them, take data out, and change what's inside.</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Variables in Real Life</h4>
                        <p>Imagine you have three boxes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>playerName</strong> = "Marcus"</li>
                            <li><strong>score</strong> = 150</li>
                            <li><strong>livesRemaining</strong> = 3</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When Marcus gets more points, the game updates the score variable:</p>
                        <p><code>score = score + 50</code> → Now score = 200</p>
                        <p>Variables can change (that's why they're called "variable"!)</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>3. Data Types: Different Kinds of Information</h4>
                    <p>Just like we organize things in real life (toys, books, clothes), programming organizes data into types:</p>

                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Data Type</th>
                            <th>What It Stores</th>
                            <th>Examples</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>String</td>
                            <td>Text (words, letters)</td>
                            <td>"Hello", "Jamaica", "🎮"</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Integer</td>
                            <td>Whole numbers</td>
                            <td>5, 42, -10, 1000</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Float/Decimal</td>
                            <td>Numbers with decimals</td>
                            <td>3.14, 98.6, -2.5</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Boolean</td>
                            <td>True or False</td>
                            <td>true, false</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>List/Array</td>
                            <td>Collection of items</td>
                            <td>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>

                    <h4>4. Conditionals: Making Decisions</h4>
                    <p>Conditionals let programs make decisions based on conditions. They use IF, ELSE IF, and ELSE statements.</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Conditional Logic</h4>
                        <pre><code>IF it's raining THEN
    Take an umbrella
ELSE IF it's sunny THEN
    Wear sunglasses
ELSE
    Just go outside normally
END IF</code></pre>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>In a game:</strong></p>
                        <pre><code>IF score > 100 THEN
    Display "You win!"
    Play victory sound
ELSE
    Display "Keep trying!"
END IF</code></pre>
                    </div>

                    <h4>5. Loops: Repeating Actions</h4>
                    <p>Loops let you repeat actions without writing the same code over and over. There are different types of loops:</p>

                    <p><strong>FOR Loop</strong> - Repeats a specific number of times</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: FOR Loop</h4>
                        <pre><code>FOR count FROM 1 TO 5
    PRINT "Count is: " + count
END FOR

Output:
Count is: 1
Count is: 2
Count is: 3
Count is: 4
Count is: 5</code></pre>
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>WHILE Loop</strong> - Repeats as long as a condition is true</p>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: WHILE Loop</h4>
                        <pre><code>lives = 3
WHILE lives > 0
    PRINT "You have " + lives + " lives"
    Play the game
    IF player gets hit THEN
        lives = lives - 1
    END IF
END WHILE
PRINT "Game Over"</code></pre>
                    </div>

                    <h4>6. Functions: Reusable Code Blocks</h4>
                    <p>Functions are like mini-programs within your program. You write them once and use them many times!</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Function</h4>
                        <pre><code>FUNCTION greetPlayer(name)
    PRINT "Welcome, " + name + "!"
    PRINT "Ready to play?"
END FUNCTION

// Using the function
greetPlayer("Marcus")  → Welcome, Marcus! Ready to play?
greetPlayer("Shanice") → Welcome, Shanice! Ready to play?</code></pre>
                        <p>Instead of writing the greeting code twice, we wrote a function once and called it twice!</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Thinking Like a Programmer</h3>
                    <p>Programming isn't just about writing code - it's about thinking logically and solving problems. Here are key programming thinking skills:</p>

                    <h4>1. Decomposition: Breaking Problems Down</h4>
                    <p>Big problems are hard to solve. Break them into smaller, manageable pieces!</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Building a Game</h4>
                        <p><strong>Big Problem:</strong> Create a complete video game</p>
                        <p><strong>Broken Down:</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Design the main character</li>
                            <li>Create movement controls</li>
                            <li>Add obstacles</li>
                            <li>Implement scoring system</li>
                            <li>Create start screen</li>
                            <li>Add game over screen</li>
                            <li>Include sound effects</li>
                            <li>Test everything</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Each small piece is easier to tackle than the whole game at once!</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4>2. Pattern Recognition: Finding Similarities</h4>
                    <p>Look for patterns and repeated actions. These can often be solved with loops or functions!</p>

                    <h4>3. Abstraction: Focusing on What Matters</h4>
                    <p>Ignore unnecessary details and focus on the important parts. When programming a car in a game, you don't need to code how the engine works - just how it moves and turns!</p>

                    <h4>4. Debugging: Finding and Fixing Errors</h4>
                    <p>All programmers make mistakes! Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors (called "bugs") in your code.</p>

                    <p>Common types of errors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Syntax Errors</strong> - Writing code incorrectly (like spelling mistakes)</li>
                        <li><strong>Logic Errors</strong> - Code runs but does the wrong thing</li>
                        <li><strong>Runtime Errors</strong> - Code crashes while running</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li><code>&lt;input type="text" id="result" readonly&gt;</code> - The display screen (readonly means you can't type in it)</li>
                        <li><code>&lt;button onclick="..."&gt;</code> - Buttons that call JavaScript functions when clicked</li>
                        <li>Each button calls a function like <code>appendNumber('7')</code> or <code>clearDisplay()</code></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Step 2: Add CSS Styling</h3>

                        <li><strong>body</strong> - Centers the calculator on the page with a purple gradient background</li>
                        <li><strong>.calculator</strong> - Dark container with rounded corners and shadow</li>
                        <li><strong>#result</strong> - Green text on dark background for the display</li>
                        <li><strong>.buttons</strong> - Uses CSS Grid to create a 4-column layout</li>
                        <li><strong>button:hover</strong> - Buttons change color and grow slightly when you hover over them</li>
                        <li><strong>.equals</strong> - The equals button is green and takes up 2 rows</li>
                        <li><strong>.zero</strong> - The zero button spans 2 columns</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Step 3: Add JavaScript Functionality</h3>
                    <p>Now for the magic! Let's add the JavaScript code that makes the calculator work. Find the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag and add this code inside it:</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Step 3: Add This JavaScript Inside the &lt;script&gt; Tags</h4>
                        <pre><code>// Get the display element
let display = document.getElementById('result');

// Function to append numbers to the display
function appendNumber(number) {
    if (display.value === '0' || display.value === 'Error') {
        display.value = number;
    } else {
        display.value += number;
    }
}

// Function to append operators (+, -, *, /)
function appendOperator(operator) {
    // Don't add operator if display is empty or already ends with an operator
    if (display.value === '' || display.value === 'Error') return;

    let lastChar = display.value[display.value.length - 1];
    if (['+', '-', '*', '/'].includes(lastChar)) return;

    display.value += operator;
}

// Function to clear the entire display
function clearDisplay() {
    display.value = '';
}

// Function to delete the last digit
function deleteDigit() {
    display.value = display.value.slice(0, -1);
}

// Function to calculate the result
function calculate() {
    try {
        // Evaluate the mathematical expression
        let result = eval(display.value);

        // Round to 8 decimal places to avoid floating point errors
        result = Math.round(result * 100000000) / 100000000;

        display.value = result;
    } catch (error) {
        // If there's an error in the calculation, show "Error"
        display.value = 'Error';
    }
}</code></pre>
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>What this JavaScript does:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>display</strong> - Gets the input element so we can update it</li>
                        <li><strong>appendNumber()</strong> - Adds numbers to the display when you click number buttons</li>
                        <li><strong>appendOperator()</strong> - Adds +, -, *, or / to the display</li>
                        <li><strong>clearDisplay()</strong> - Clears everything (the C button)</li>
                        <li><strong>deleteDigit()</strong> - Removes the last character (the DEL button)</li>
                        <li><strong>calculate()</strong> - Does the math and shows the result (the = button)</li>
                        <li><strong>try/catch</strong> - If there's an error (like dividing by text), it shows "Error"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Step 4: Test Your Calculator!</h3>
                    <div class="experiment-box">
                        <h4>🧪 Let's Test It!</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Save your file</strong> as "calculator.html"</li>
                            <li><strong>Double-click the file</strong> to open it in your web browser</li>
                            <li><strong>Try these calculations:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>5 + 3 = (should show 8)</li>
                                    <li>10 - 4 = (should show 6)</li>
                                    <li>6 * 7 = (should show 42)</li>
                                    <li>20 / 4 = (should show 5)</li>
                                    <li>5 + 3 * 2 = (should show 11, because multiplication happens first!)</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Test the buttons:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Try the C button to clear</li>
                                    <li>Try the DEL button to delete the last digit</li>
                                    <li>Try clicking buttons with your mouse</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>

                    <h3>How It Works: Behind the Scenes</h3>
                    <p>Let's understand what happens when you calculate 5 + 3:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>You click button "5" → <code>appendNumber('5')</code> runs → display shows "5"</li>
                        <li>You click button "+" → <code>appendOperator('+')</code> runs → display shows "5+"</li>
                        <li>You click button "3" → <code>appendNumber('3')</code> runs → display shows "5+3"</li>
                        <li>You click button "=" → <code>calculate()</code> runs → JavaScript evaluates "5+3" → display shows "8"</li>
                    </ol>

                    <div class="important-note">
                        <h4>📌 Understanding eval()</h4>
                        <p>The <code>eval()</code> function takes a string like "5+3" and evaluates it as JavaScript code, returning 8. It's perfect for our calculator!</p>
                        <p><strong>Important:</strong> In real-world applications, <code>eval()</code> can be dangerous if you're evaluating user input from the internet. But for our calculator where we control all the inputs, it's safe and perfect!</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>🎨 Challenge: Customize Your Calculator!</h3>
                    <p>Now that your calculator works, try making it your own! Here are some ideas:</p>

                    <h4>Easy Customizations:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Change colors:</strong> Modify the background colors, button colors, or text colors</li>
                        <li><strong>Change the title:</strong> Change "My Calculator" to your name, like "Marcus's Calculator"</li>
                        <li><strong>Try different fonts:</strong> Change <code>font-family</code> to "Georgia", "Courier", or "Comic Sans MS"</li>
                        <li><strong>Adjust sizes:</strong> Make buttons bigger or smaller by changing the <code>height</code> value</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Medium Customizations:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Add a percentage button (%):</strong> Add a new button that divides the number by 100</li>
                        <li><strong>Add a +/- button:</strong> Make numbers negative or positive</li>
                        <li><strong>Add sound effects:</strong> Make buttons beep when clicked!</li>
                        <li><strong>Change button layout:</strong> Rearrange where buttons are positioned</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Advanced Customizations:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Add keyboard support:</strong> Let users type numbers on their keyboard</li>
                        <li><strong>Add history:</strong> Show previous calculations</li>
                        <li><strong>Add scientific functions:</strong> Square root, exponents, sin/cos</li>
                        <li><strong>Add memory functions:</strong> M+, M-, MR, MC buttons</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Example: Adding a Square Button</h4>
                        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Add this button in your HTML buttons section:</p>
                        <pre><code>&lt;button onclick="square()"&gt;x²&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
                        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add this function in your JavaScript:</p>
                        <pre><code>function square() {
    if (display.value === '' || display.value === 'Error') return;
    let num = parseFloat(display.value);
    display.value = num * num;
}</code></pre>
                        <p>Now you have a button that squares any number!</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>📌 Chapter 12: Exercise 2 - Build a To-Do List App with localStorage!</h2>

                    <h3>🎯 What You'll Build</h3>
                    <p>In this advanced exercise, you'll create a To-Do List app that remembers your tasks even after you close the browser! This introduces you to <strong>CRUD operations</strong> (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and <strong>localStorage</strong> - a way to save data in the browser.</p>

                    <p>This project will teach you:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>CREATE</strong> - Add new tasks to your list</li>
                        <li><strong>READ</strong> - Display all tasks</li>
                        <li><strong>UPDATE</strong> - Mark tasks as complete or incomplete</li>
                        <li><strong>DELETE</strong> - Remove tasks from your list</li>
                        <li>How to save data in the browser with localStorage</li>
                        <li>How to work with arrays and objects</li>
                        <li>How to dynamically create HTML elements with JavaScript</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="important-note">
                        <h4>📌 What is CRUD?</h4>
                        <p>CRUD stands for the four basic operations you can do with data:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Create</strong> - Make new data (add a task)</li>
                            <li><strong>Read</strong> - View existing data (show all tasks)</li>
                            <li><strong>Update</strong> - Change existing data (mark task complete)</li>
                            <li><strong>Delete</strong> - Remove data (delete a task)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Almost every app uses CRUD! Instagram lets you Create posts, Read your feed, Update captions, and Delete posts. That's CRUD in action!</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Understanding localStorage</h3>
                    <p>Before we build, let's understand <strong>localStorage</strong> - it's like a storage box in your browser where you can save data!</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 localStorage Basics</h4>
                        <pre><code>// Save data (CREATE/UPDATE)
localStorage.setItem('name', 'Marcus');
localStorage.setItem('score', '100');

// Get data (READ)
let name = localStorage.getItem('name'); // Returns 'Marcus'
let score = localStorage.getItem('score'); // Returns '100'

// Delete data (DELETE)
localStorage.removeItem('name');

// Delete all data
localStorage.clear();</code></pre>
                        <p><strong>Important:</strong> localStorage can only store strings (text). To store arrays or objects, we need to convert them to strings using JSON.stringify() and back using JSON.parse().</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Step 1: Create the HTML File</h3>
                    <p>Create a new file called <strong>todo.html</strong> and add this code:</p>

                    <div class="example-box">
                        <h4>💡 Step 1: Complete HTML Structure</h4>
                        <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My To-Do List&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
        /* CSS will go here in Step 2 */
    &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;📝 My To-Do List&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Stay organized and get things done!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;!-- Input area to add new tasks --&gt;
        &lt;div class="input-area"&gt;
            &lt;input
                type="text"
                id="taskInput"
                placeholder="Enter a new task..."
                onkeypress="handleKeyPress(event)"&gt;
            &lt;button onclick="addTask()"&gt;Add Task&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

                    <p>Want to see your data stored in the browser? Here's how:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12 or right-click → Inspect)</li>
                        <li>Go to the "Application" tab (Chrome) or "Storage" tab (Firefox)</li>
                        <li>Look for "localStorage" in the left sidebar</li>
                        <li>Click on your website's domain</li>
                        <li>You'll see "todoTasks" with all your data as a JSON string!</li>
                    </ol>

                        <h4>⭐ Fun Fact!</h4>
                        <p>localStorage can store up to 5-10 MB of data (depending on the browser) - that's enough for thousands of tasks! Professional apps often use more advanced storage like IndexedDB for even more data. The localStorage API was introduced in HTML5 in 2009, and before that, websites used cookies (which could only store 4KB!)</p>
